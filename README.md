Antarctic heat flow models

The code reproduces the resuls published in [G-cubed](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GC009428#.X-6Jn2Sm28U)

The provided Jupyter notebook reproduces the model and and figures in the paper, including supplimentary material. The notebook also generates some additional tests and figures, not included in the paper. Note that the previous version of agrid is used for this study. Please get in touch if you have dependency issues to reproduce the results. 

A recent update of pyproj, and sloppy version control from my side, caused some dependency issues. I'll attend those problems as soon as I get time, for now, the solution is to downgrade pyproj and matplotlib. Sorry. Let me know if you intend to use the code, as I am working on a refined workflow.
